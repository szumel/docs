## 2. Running the tests

This project is not test driven.

## 3. Versioning

GIT is used for version management.

1. master - main production branch
2. develop - main stable branch with newest features
3. feature - feature development branch
4. release - representing features bundle in stable state

#### 3.1 Development

Workflow: 
1. Feature

* Feature branch must be created from develop branch
* Stable feature must be merged back into develop branch

```bash
---DEVELOPMENT---
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature-1 develop

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature-1
git push origin develop
---END DEVELOPMENT---
```
#### 3.2 Deployment

1. Release 

* Release branch must be created from master branch
* Stable develop branch must be merged into release branch
* Stable release branch (merged with develop) 
should be merged into master branch
* Master branch should be tagged and pushed to origin with tags

```bash
---DEPLOYMENT---
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release-1 master
git merge develop
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release-1
git tag 0.1
git push origin master --tags
---END DEPLOYMENT---
```
